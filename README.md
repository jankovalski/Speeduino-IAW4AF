# Speeduino-IAW4AF

Plug & play Speeduino ECU for IAW 4AF header/case.

I made this to be compatibile with Seicento 1.1 MPI wiring harness.

There's no schematic. I never created one because I didn't need it. The board design is based on the official v0.4.3 schematic except for the VR conditioner - I made it on a popular LM258 op-amp. Works very well with the 60-2 trigger wheel.
